# Overview / Setup

After seeing Web Dev Cody upload a video where he attempts this challenge, I immediately paused it and decided to have at it myself. And when I do these kinds of challenges, I like to expand on them. In this case, it was mostly about adding test cases. Also, when I went back to Cody's video to see his solution, I saw his end result didn't include the functionality of ensuring the presence of at least one character from the selected (checked) character types. I'm obviously not saying he couldn't achieve that as it was a relatively short video and he probably just didn't intend to cover all use cases.

I am using React + Typescript setup with Vite along with Tailwind for quick styling. As far as testing goes, I'm using React Testing Library with the Vitest framework.
